# Features Coming Soon to Activist Beta (Premium):

* AI Content detector:

In the age of AI it will become more difficult to differ from original content. Artificial Intelligence can be used to generate/create stunning images, and videos that can take what would normally be a crediable source and make it report/say any information the user wants them to say. We are working on rolling our features to check for any indicators that the video/images/source is authentic.
